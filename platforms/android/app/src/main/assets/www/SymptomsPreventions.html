			<h2 style="text-align:center;">How to Protect Yourself & Others</h2>
			<br><h3>I - Wear a mask over your nose and mouth</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li>Masks help prevent you from getting or spreading the virus.</li>
				<li>You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.</li>
				<li>Everyone should wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">mask</a>&nbsp;in public settings and when around people who don&rsquo;t live in your household, especially when other <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">social distancing</a> measures are difficult to maintain.
					<ul>
						<li>Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders.</li>
				<li>Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br><h3>II - Stay 6 feet away from others</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li><strong>Inside your home: </strong>Avoid close contact with people who are sick<strong>.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Outside your home: </strong>Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don&rsquo;t live in your household.
					<ul>
						<li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms&rsquo; length) from other people</a>.</li>
						<li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-increased-risk.html">people who are at higher risk of getting very sick</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br><h3>III - Wash your hands often</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html">Wash your hands</a> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
				<li>It&rsquo;s especially important to wash:
					<ul>
						<li>Before eating or preparing food</li>
						<li>Before touching your face</li>
						<li>After using the restroom</li>
						<li>After leaving a public place</li>
						<li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
						<li>After handling your mask</li>
						<li>After changing a diaper</li>
						<li>After caring for someone sick</li>
						<li>After touching animals or pets</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If soap and water are not readily available, <strong>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol</strong>. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoid touching</strong> <strong>your eyes, nose, and mouth</strong> with unwashed hands.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br><h3>IV - Cover coughs and sneezes</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li><strong>Always cover your mouth and nose</strong> with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.</li>
				<li><strong>Throw used tissues</strong> in the trash.</li>
				<li>Immediately <strong>wash your hands</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br><h3>V - Clean and disinfect</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li><strong>Clean AND disinfect </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html"><strong>frequently touched surfaces</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;daily</strong>. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
				<li><strong>If surfaces are dirty, clean them.</strong> Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
				<li><strong>Then, use a household disinfectant.</strong> Use products from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19" class="tp-link-policy" data-domain-ext="gov">EPA&rsquo;s List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)<span class="sr-only">external icon</span><span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>&nbsp;according to manufacturer&rsquo;s labeled directions.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br><h3>VI - Monitor Your Health Daily</h3>
			<ul align="justify">
				<li><strong>Be alert for symptoms.</strong> Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">other symptoms</a><strong>&nbsp;of COVID-19. </strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Especially important if you are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html">running essential errands</a>, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">physical distance of 6 feet</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Take your temperature</strong> if symptoms develop.
					<ul>
						<li>Don&rsquo;t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">CDC guidance</a>&nbsp;if symptoms develop.</li>
